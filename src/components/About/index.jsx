              Hey! My name is Dennis Cortes.
            </p>
            <p className="f4 space-mono lh-copy black-60">
              Amongst a couple other clich√© designer traits, I love coffee and the craft
              and culture behind it. I enjoy making my own coffee at home and experimenting
              with different roasts and brewing methods. Over time I've wanted to keep a
              record of coffee shops, roasts, brewing methods, and tools I try out.
            </p>
            <p className="f4 space-mono lh-copy black-60">
              Hence, Taste Notes was born. A little side project for me to update and keep
              memories of my coffee experiences and preferences. This project is mainly for
              myself, but I love seeing people enjoy this site and share their love for coffee.
            </p>
            <p className="mb5 f4 space-mono lh-copy black-60">
              If you'd like to support the site, pick up some coffee tools from the Gear page!
